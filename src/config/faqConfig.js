    {
      question: "How does Zerion bypass Byfron/Hyperion?",
      answer: "Zerion operates entirely server-side, integrated directly into the game environment. This means it completely bypasses client-side anti-cheat systems like Byfron/Hyperion, as no local modifications are required."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Zerion safe to use?",
      answer: "Yes! Since Zerion runs server-side, there's no risk of client detection or bans. Our implementation ensures your account stays secure while maintaining full functionality."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I start using Zerion?",
      answer: "Simply purchase your preferred plan, and you'll receive instant access. No downloads or installations needed - just join any supported game and start executing!"
    },
    {
      question: "What makes Zerion different from other executors?",
      answer: "Zerion is fully server-sided, meaning everything you execute is visible to everyone in the server. This provides unique capabilities not possible with traditional client-side executors."
    },
